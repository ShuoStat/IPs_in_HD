# Influential Observation Detection in High-Dimensional Data  

The rise of high-dimensional data has driven the development of specialized regression methods, but diagnostic techniques remain underdeveloped. Classical diagnostic approaches for low-dimensional data are often unsuitable due to conceptual and computational challenges. We investigate methods for detecting influential points (IPs) affecting variable selection or prediction accuracy in high-dimensional data. Using gradient boosting, we applied these methods to six datasets (five binary, one survival).
