## Reproducing the Results of Influential Points Detection in Digh-dimensional Data

The repository contains the data and codes necessary for reproducing the results of influential points (IPs) detection in high-dimensional data. The repository is organized into four folders:

1. **codes**: R codes for reproducing the results are stored in this folder.
2. **data**: This folder contains the data used in the analyses.
3. **results**: Here you can find the figures or tables produced.
4. **outputs**: This folder saves the intermediate generated results.

## How to run the program

**First** Run the *1 mstops, variable selection.R*.
**Second** Run the *2 prediction.R*.
